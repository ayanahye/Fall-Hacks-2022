### General Info:
Hello my name is Ayana Hussain and I am doing this hackathon alone. I decided to make a Website Blocker after a long period of thinking about the theme. Funny story, as I was thinking I kept getting notifications from websites on Chrome and then I thought of making a Website Blocker. This website is helpful when you wanna block potentially dangerous websites or just hide websites you don't like. Similarly, you can use this website to unblock other websites that may have been accidentally blocked by the browser. 

The reason it fits the theme is because as mentioned on the website, if you are on a dodgy website and you wanna prevent attacks and the like, you can simply block  it last minute using this application.

Thank you for this opportunity.
